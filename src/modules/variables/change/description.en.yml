name: Variable change

theory: |
    
  The word "variable" itself means that it can be changed. Indeed, over time within the program, the values ​​of the variables may change.
    
  ```java
  // greeting - translated as greeting
  String greeting = "Father!";
  System.out.print(greeting);
  System.out.print(greeting);
  greeting = "Mother!";
  System.out.print(greeting);
  System.out.print(greeting);
  ```
  The name remains the same, but inside the other data. It should be noted that when changing variables, the type is not necessary.
    
  Variables are powerful, and at the same time dangerous thing. One can never be exactly sure what is written inside it without analyzing the code that is in front of the variable. This is exactly what the developers are doing during debugging, when they are trying to figure out why the program is not working or is not working as intended.
