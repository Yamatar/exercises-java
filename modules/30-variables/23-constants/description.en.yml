name: Constants
theory: |

  Some data, such as mathematical constants, never changes. Take the number π. Approximately it is always equal to `3.14` and cannot change.

  To access such data in Java, it is customary to use constants.

  ```java
  final double PI = 3.14;
  println(PI); // 3.14
  ```

  Creating a constant is different from creating a variable. It starts with the keyword `final` and the following constant name. You do not need a dollar sign. Next, it is assigned the desired value. Constants are usually called uppercase letters with `_` as a delimiter. A constant, like a variable, can be used in any expression. The only restriction is that the constant cannot be changed, which sounds quite logical.

  Create the constant `DRAGONS_BORN_COUNT` and write the number 3 in it - the number of dragons born to Dayenerys.
