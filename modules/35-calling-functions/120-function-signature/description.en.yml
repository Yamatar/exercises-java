name: Function signature

  The `indexOf` function, which returns the index in this line of the first occurrence of the specified substring, takes 1 parameter: **which substring to search**. If you call `inexOf` without parameters, Java will produce the following: `no suitable method found for indexOf (no arguments`. We are told that such a function indexOf without parameters does not exist.

  How do we know how many parameters do the `indexOf` functions need and what type of“ return ”will there be? We looked at the **signature** of this function. The signature determines the input parameters and their types, as well as the output parameter and its type. About the function `indexOf` you can read in [official Java documentation] (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)).

  You can pass parameters only in the sequence in which they are defined in the signature.

  Any function always returns only one value. This restriction exists at the language level and cannot be violated.

  Now it's your turn to look at the function signature in the documentation and figure out how to use it. You can read the documentation in Russian, but the programmer must be able to read the documentation in English. Use dictionaries or translators if necessary. It is better to immediately get used to and tighten up reading skills in English, otherwise there will be difficulties in the future.

  In Java, the String class has a function `concat`. Examine its signature at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#concat(java.lang.String]].

  Write a program that uses the `concat` function with the` text` variable and displays the result on the screen.
