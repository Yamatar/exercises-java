name: Function call in function arguments
theory: |

  We continue the theme of expressions. As you remember, **a function call is an expression**, which means we can put a function call into a function call (... function call, a function call into a call ... aaaa!).

  ```java
  String result = "Hello".concat(" world".concat("!"));
  ```

  We call the function `concat` and pass one argument to it:

Â  - the result of calling the function `concat` with the argument `"!"`

  You can do the same, but with intermediate steps:

  ```java
  String secondWord = " world".concat("!");
  String result = "Hello".concat(secondWord);
  ```

  Which option is preferable? If the calculation is quite simple and shallow (no more than one function embedding), then you can safely put the call into the call. In other situations, it is preferable to split the calls into intermediate calculations.

  The reasons are the same. Reading this code is much easier. First, intermediate variables by their names reflect the essence of operations. Secondly, such code is easier to debug, and intermediate data is easier to explore. And thirdly, deep nested challenges are difficult to read.

  To build the family tree of the Starks family, Sam wrote the `parentFor` function, which returns the name of the parent if the first parameter is the name of the child. The second parameter function takes the line `father` or` mother`. So the function understands which parent to return. The default setting is `mother`. That is, if you want to know the name of the mother, then you can not pass on the special `mother`, but pass only one parameter - the child's name.

  Write a program that displays the name **grandfather **Joffrey on the maternal line. Full name of Joffrey: `Joffrey Baratheon`.
