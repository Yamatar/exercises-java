name: Arguments as expressions
theory: |

  Consider this code:

  ```java
  String result = "Hello".concat(" world!");
  ```

  The function `concat` is called with the argument `" world!"`.

  We found out that *expressions turn into values​​*. That is, from the Java point of view, values ​​and expressions are something similar. Therefore, any values ​​in the program can technically be replaced by expressions.

  When calling a function, you can pass an expression **into it with the argument**:

  ```java
  String result = "Hello".concat(" world" + "!");
  ```

  The result will be the same as in the first example, because the expression `" world" + "!"` Will turn into the value `" world!"`, And with this argument the call `concat` will occur.

  Moreover, you can use variables interspersed with values ​​and other expressions:

  ```java
  String sign = "!";
  String result = "Hello".concat(" world" + sign);
  ```

  Naturally, this works not only with strings, but with any values ​​and expressions. For example, with strings.

  Let's summarize. Take a look at a few examples from the current lesson:

  ```java

  // простые вызовы
  String result = "Hello".concat(" world!");         // Hello world!

  // выражения в аргументах
  String result = "Hello".concat(" world" + "!");    // Hello world!

  // выражения с переменными в аргументах
  String sign = "!";
  String result = "Hello".concat(" world" + sign);   // Hello world!
  ```

  Notice the similarity: in all calls, some information is passed to the function, but sometimes it is a simple, “ready” value (`" world!"`), And sometimes a compound expression - "not ready" value (`" world!"`, " world" + sign, etc). In this case, one argument is passed in all the examples. When there are several arguments, they are necessarily separated by commas.

  The function `calculateDistanceBetweenTowns` is available to you. It takes one argument, which must contain the names of the two cities through a hyphen. In response, it returns the distance between these cities. Here is an example of use:

  ```java
  int distance = calculateDistanceBetweenTowns("Lannisport-Bayasabhad");
  ```

  Write a program that uses the `calculateDistanceBetweenTowns` function and displays the distance between cities recorded in the `from` and `to` variables.
