name: Syntax errors
theory: |

  If the Java program is written syntactically incorrectly, then the interpreter displays a corresponding message on the screen, as well as an indication of the file and the line in it, where, in his opinion, an error occurred. ** Syntax error ** occurs when the code was written in violation of grammatical rules. In human languages, grammar is important, but text with errors can most often be understood and read. In programming, everything is strict. Any minute violation, and the program will not even start. An example would be forgotten `;`, incorrectly placed brackets and other details.

  Here is a sample code with a syntax error:

  ```java
  print("Hodor")
  ```

  If we run the code above, we will see the following message: Error: (4, 34) java: ';' expected.

  On the one hand, the "Parse error" errors are the simplest ones, because they are associated exclusively with the grammatical rules of writing code, and not with the very meaning of the code. They are easy to fix: you just need to find a violation in the record.

  On the other hand, the interpreter may not always clearly indicate this violation. Therefore, it happens that the forgotten bracket must be placed not in the direction indicated by the error message.

  This task is not directly related to the lesson. But it will be useful to practice with the output on the screen.
