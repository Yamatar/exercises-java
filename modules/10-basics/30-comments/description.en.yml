name: Comments
theory: |

  Virtually all programming languages ​​allow you to leave comments in the code. They are not used by the interpreter in any way and are necessary only for people: for the programmer to leave notes for himself and for other programmers. Comments in Java come in two forms:

  ** Single line comments ** begin with `//`. After these two characters, any text can follow, the entire line will not be analyzed and executed.

  A comment can occupy the entire line:

  // For Winterfell!

  or it may be on a line after some code:

  `` java
  println ("I am the King"); // For Lannisters!
  ```

  **Multi-line comments** begin with `/ *` and end with `* /`.

  `` java
  / *
    The night is dark and
    full of terrors.
   * /
  println ("I am the King");
  ```

instructions: |
  Create a single line comment with the text: `You know nothing, Jon Snow!`.
