  Virtually all programming languages ​​allow you to leave comments in the code. They are not used by the interpreter in any way and are necessary only for people: for the programmer to leave notes for himself and for other programmers. Comments in Java are of three types:

  ** Single line comments ** begin with `//`. After these two characters, any text can follow, the entire line will not be analyzed and executed.

  A comment can occupy the entire line:

  ```java
  // For Winterfell!
  ```

  or it may be on a line after some code:

  ```java
  println ("I am the King") // For Lannisters!
  ```

  *Multi-line comments** begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. It is customary to begin each line with the character `*`, although technically it is not necessary.

  ```java
  /*
   * The night is dark and
   * full of terrors.
   */
  println ("I am the King")
  ```

  **Documentary comments** begin with `/**` and end with `*/` and it is already necessary for them to begin each line with the character `*`.

  Documentary comments, being, in fact, a subline of multi-line, have an additional function - they can be collected using a special javadoc utility and issued as documentation to your code. We will talk about them later - when we examine the classes and methods.

instructions: |
  Create a single line comment with the text: `You know nothing, John Snow!`.
