  The instruction is a command for the computer. Java code is a set of instructions that are usually separated from each other by the `;`.
  Here is an example code with two instructions:

  ```java
  System.out.print("Mother of Dragons.");
  System.out.print("Dracarys!");
  ```

  When you run this code, two sentences are displayed sequentially:

  ```
  Mother of Dragons.Dracarys!
  ```

  Theoretically, you can write instructions one after the other without transferring to a new line:

  ```java
  System.out.print("Mother of Dragons."); System.out.print("Dracarys!");
  ```

  The result on the screen will be the same, but in practice this approach is considered bad.

  Display three names one after another: `Robert`,` Stannis`, `Renly`. As a result, the screen should display:

  ```
  RobertStannisRenly
  ```
    
  For each name, use your own `System.out.print` call.
