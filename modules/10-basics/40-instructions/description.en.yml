  The instruction is a command for the computer. Java code is a set of instructions that are usually separated from each other by the `;`.

  Here is a sample code with two instructions.

  ``java
  print ("Mother of Dragons.");
  print ("Dracarys!");
  ```

  When you run this code, two sentences are displayed sequentially:

  ```
  Mother of Dragons.Dracarys!
  ```

  Theoretically, you can write instructions one after the other without transferring to a new line:

  ``java
  print ("Mother of Dragons."); print ("Dracarys!");
  ```

  The result on the screen will be the same, but in practice this approach is considered bad.

instructions: |
  Display one after the other three names: "Robert", "Stannis", "Renly". As a result, the screen should display:

  ```
  RobertStannisRenly
  ```

  For each name, use your own "print" call.
