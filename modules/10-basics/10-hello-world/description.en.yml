name: Hello World!
theory: |
  By tradition, let's start by writing the program 'Hello, World!'. This program will display the text:

  ```
  Hello, World!
  ```

  To display something on the screen, you need to give the computer a special command. In Java, this command is `println`.

instructions: |
  Type in the code from the task a symbol into a symbol in the editor and click "Check".

  ```java
  println("Hello, World!")
  ```

  Note: if you write `heLLo, woRld!` Instead of `Hello, World!`, Then this will be considered different text, because uppercase and lowercase letters are different characters. The size of the letter is called * register *, and they say: ** the register is important! ** This applies to almost everything in the code, so get used to always pay attention to the register.

    To repeat this on your computer, you need:
    * install JDK 9 or later,
    * run the JSHell utility by typing "jshell" in the command line and pressing "Enter"
    * execute a command that loads the println function - "/ open PRINTING" (or simply "/ o PRINTING")
    * alternatively, you can immediately start jshell with the start key: `jshell --start PRINTING` - the result will be the same
    * enter the command `println` and press Enter to see the result
    * To exit the JShell utility, type the command "/ exit" (or simply "/ ex")
