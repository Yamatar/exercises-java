name: Hello World!
theory: |
  By tradition, let's start by writing the program 'Hello, World!'. This program will display the text:

  ```
  Hello, World!
  ```

  To display something on the screen, you need to give the computer a special command. In Java, this command is `println`.

instructions: |
  Type in the code from the task a symbol into a symbol in the editor and click "Check".

  ```java
  System.out.print("Hello, World!")
  ```

  Note: if you write `heLLo, woRld!` Instead of `Hello, World!`, Then this will be considered different text, because uppercase and lowercase letters are different characters. The size of the letter is called * register *, and they say: ** the register is important! ** This applies to almost everything in the code, so get used to always pay attention to the register.
