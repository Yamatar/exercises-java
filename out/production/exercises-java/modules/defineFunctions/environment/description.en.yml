  What value will be inside the `result` variable after executing the code?

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 5;
    int result = generate();
  }

  public static int generate() {
    return age + 3;
  }
  ```

  The correct answer is: the code will fail with an error. Because inside the function there is no variable named `age`, but the function tries to use it.

  The function is an isolated black box. Everything that is defined outside the function has nothing to do with what is defined inside. In the function body there is a program isolated from the external environment (external environment).

  Consider another example:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 5;
    int result = generate();
  }

  public static int generate() {
    int age = 10;
    return age + 3;
  }
  ```

  In this case, the result will be the number `13`. The external value of `age = 5` does not affect the function code.

  This task is not directly related to the lesson, it is just another useful exercise in working with functions.

   Write a function `getAgeDifference`, which takes two years of birth and returns a string with an age difference in the form` The age difference is 11`.

  Recall that in Java there is a `Math.abs` function that returns the module of the transferred number: for example, `Math.abs (-12)` will return `12`.
