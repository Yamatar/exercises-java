name: Operators
theory: |

  Before moving on, let's look at the basic terminology. The sign of an operation, such as `+`, is called **operator**. An operator is simply a symbol that performs some operation. As you will learn further, operators are not only arithmetic.

  ```java
  System.out.print(8 + 2);
  ```

  In this example, `+` is an operator, and the numbers `8` and` 2` are **operands**.

  In the case of addition, we have two operands: one to the left, the other to the right of the `+` sign. Operations that require two operands are called **binary**. If you skip at least one operand, for example, like `3 +;`, then the program will not start because it will contain a syntax error.

  Operations are not only binary, but also unary (with one operand) and even ternary (with three operands)! Moreover, operators may look the same, but denote different operations.

  ```java
  System.out.print(-3); // => -3
  ```

  The above is an example of applying a unary operation to the number `3`. The minus operator before the three tells the interpreter to take the number `3` and find the opposite, that is,` -3`.

  This can be a bit confusing, because `-3` is both a number in itself and an operator with an operand, but programming languages ​​have such a structure.

  Write a program that calculates the difference between `6` and` -81` and displays the answer on the screen.
